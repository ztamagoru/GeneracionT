                    <center>Go Help</center>
                </h1>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <p>Hauling yourself up, you cautiously move toward the sound of the person seemingly trapped in the
                wreckage. Climbing up the caved-in side of an overturned subway car you peer over to see a horrific
                sight. Train cars and bodies are smashed together in a grizzly mess that makes your stomach lurch.
                Severed limbs and broken corpses litter the debris, while one particularly gruesome body has literally
                had its entrails torn out and spread over a large bloody swath. Of particularly chilling detail, you
                notice shuffling footprints moving through the mess, leaving a trail on the other side of the pileup,
                and headed off toward the front of the train wreck.</p>

                <p>You again hear the desperate thrashing sounds and follow them to where two train cars have slammed
                together side-to-side. There, a man is trapped between the two cars just above the waist. You have no
                idea how he could still be alive, as the damage looks grave. You can’t see it from here, but you can
                imagine his pelvis and legs have probably been sheared off and right now, only the pressure of the train
                cars slammed together holds his insides from falling out beneath him. The man looks like he is in shock
                and snarls, thrashing wildly, trying to pull himself free. He does seem to be slowly extracting himself.
                You also notice a lot of blood around his mouth and throat – probably what he has spit up since getting
                pinned.</p>
