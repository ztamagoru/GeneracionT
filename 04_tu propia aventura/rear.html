            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <p>You move quickly, ignoring the mess behind you and the throbbing pain of your injuries, making your way
                over and through the wreckage of the train cars that scatter the tunnel in the direction the train was
                coming from before the wreck.</p>

                <p>Along the way you see dead bodies everywhere, smashed into the twisted metal of the wrecked train cars –
                each more gruesome than the last. Disturbingly, you also notice an unusually large amount of entrails
                scattered about. You somehow doubt that that many people could all have been disemboweled simultaneously
                by a simple train wreck – even one as serious as this one appears to be. You’re not sure (and you
                certainly don’t want to get close enough to find out firsthand), but some of the bodies even look as if
                they have recently been savaged, as if by some wild animals’ rending jaws. Damn! Are these zombies
                you’re dealing with?!? Is that possible?</p>

                <p>As you get further along, you also notice a large number of bloody footprints headed in the same
                direction you are going. They seem to be joined by more and more footprints as you pass through one
                mangled subway car after another.</p>

                <p>It is not long before you get to the last car of the train you had been riding on. In walking, you
                surmise that you had been on the train and thrown out a window when it crashed. You must have struck
                your head when you landed, which knocked you out for who knows how long. On that thought, you risk
                approaching a random victim’s arm sticking out of the wreckage to take their watch. Unlike yours, this
                one still works and indicates the time to be 7:55 pm. If that is correct, and your watch indicates the
                time of the crash, that means you were out of it for roughly twelve hours. Wow, you’d better not go back
                to sleep until you can get yourself to a hospital or you might not wake up again. You also find a
                working cell phone in the aisle as you go and see that it still works, but there’s no signal down here
                in the subway tunnel.</p>

                <p>Looking down the dark tunnel from the last car of your train, you wonder how long the batteries in your
                penlight will last. You’ll also have illumination from your cell phone in a pinch, but then you have no
                weapons. What if you run into whatever has been shredding all these bodies? In that case, maybe you
                really don’t want a light to see what it is with…</p>

                <p>You also see that all the bloody footprints leave the train at this point and continue down the tunnel
                in the direction the train was coming from. They are quickly lost however in the hard-packed dirt and
                darkness of the tunnel itself – though following them won’t be a problem – you only got one direction to
                go – unless you want to turn around and go back the way you just came.</p>
