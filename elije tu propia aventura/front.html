            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <p>You move quickly, ignoring the mess behind you and the throbbing pain of your injuries, making your way
                over and through the wreckage of the train cars that scatter the tunnel in the direction the train was
                headed before the wreck.</p>

                <p>Along the way you see dead bodies everywhere, smashed into the twisted metal of the wrecked train cars –
                each more gruesome than the last. Disturbingly, you also notice an unusually large amount of entrails
                scattered about. You somehow doubt that that many people could all have been disemboweled simultaneously
                by a simple train wreck – even one as serious as this one appears to be. You’re not sure (and you
                certainly don’t want to get close enough to find out firsthand), but some of the bodies even look as if
                they have recently been savaged, as if by some wild animals’ rending jaws. As you get further along, you
                also notice a large number of bloody footprints headed in the same direction you are going. They seem to
                be joined by more and more footprints as you pass through one mangled subway car after another.</p>

                <p>At length you get to the front of the train you must have been riding on. In walking, you surmise that
                you had been on the train and thrown out a window when it crashed. You must have struck your head when
                you landed, which knocked you out for who knows how long. On that thought, you risk approaching a random
                victim’s arm sticking out of the wreckage to take their watch. Unlike yours, this one still works and
                indicates the time to be 6:04 pm. If that is correct, and your watch indicates the time of the crash,
                that means you were out of it for roughly ten hours. Wow, you’d better not go back to sleep until you
                can get yourself to a hospital or you might not wake up again. You also find a working cell phone in the
                aisle as you go and see that it still works, but there’s no signal down here in the subway tunnel.</p>

                <p>Looking at the first car of your train, you see that it is completely flattened under the rear cars of
                another train. It looks as if the first train was stopped on the tracks and your train somehow ran into
                the back of it at a rather high rate of speed.</p>

                <p>Continuing on, you cautiously pass through the scattered cars of this train with much the same scene of
                carnage cast before your eyes, until you finally arrive at the head of the first train. Unlike your
                train the first car of this train is relatively intact. You know that at the very front of the train is
                a control room, which hopefully will have at least a first aid kit and if you’re lucky, a working radio.
                As you approach, you see that all the bloody footprints leave the train at this point and continue down
                the tunnel in the direction the train was headed. They are quickly lost however in the hard-packed dirt
                and darkness of the tunnel itself – though following them won’t be a problem – you only got one
                direction to go – unless you want to turn around and go back the way you just came.</p>
